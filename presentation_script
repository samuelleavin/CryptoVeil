- Show the original Gmail message “Show Original” so people can see that it really is encrypted in transit and in storage - (DEMO)
- Send it to someone else and have them open up the email and then “Show Original"- (DEMO)

INTRO - SAM: 

Hi,  My name is Sam and this is Rachel Lee, Angie Yang, and Tom Proenza.  We are Cryptoveil.  We created a chrome extension that lets you encrypt data posted to third party apps in order to protect sensitive data.  Users can create circles that have unique keys which will automatically de-crypt data for users of that group.

PROBLEM - RACHEL: 

Have you ever had a time when you have sent private information using third party services?  Maybe you have sent a picture of your driver’s license, your credit card info, or a hot new business idea?  Did you realize these services can easily access or accidentally leak your information?  We all know organizations' security is sometimes compromised and our data is exposed.  Our team is interested in adding an extra layer of protection. With our extension, you can effortlessly secure your data, with peace of mind by using government standard encryption.

[DEMO - START WITH LOGIN] - TOM

MAJOR FEATS. - TOM:  Now that you’ve heard the general idea, let us show you an example.  If we go to circle management, we can create a group for me and my fellow developers.
[MAKE A CIRCLE AND ADD A MEMBER]
Now I want to send us all an idea for a cool new CryptoVeil feature.
[ENABLE ENCRYPTION AND SELECT GROUP]
I will enable encryption and select a group that contains the collaborators.  These will be the only people able to view the contents.  If I forgot to pick a circle, I will get a friendly reminder to pick one.
[COMPOSE AND SEND AN EMAIL “This is a cool, new idea!”]

[ANGIE LOGS INTO EMAIL] - ANGIE
[WE HAVE MULTIPLE EMAILS FROM TOM]

ANGIE: If I open an email and see an email from Tom filled with gibberish.  All I have to do is log in to CryptoVeil and ta-daa, I can see Tom’s cool, new idea!  One of the great features of our extension is everything happens under the hood; our team members don’t need to enter in a password every time they want to read these encrypted emails, at the same time remaining confident everything is secure.
Another great feature is the ability to stay logged in even if you close a browser tab, or open a tab for another supported site . 
????Your session will persist between our web app and extension????

-- IMPLEMENTATION-
----------------------
[SHOW EXTENSION DIAGRAM] - SAM

SAM - In order to accomplish all this, we decided to construct a chrome extension because of its capabilites. It allows us to read, modify, and interact with web pages and servers.  The basic structure of our extension contains a popup, background page, and content script, with additional site specific scripts.  For instance, on gmail, we have a separate scripts for encryption and decryption. The content script allows two-way communication  by using event emitters.  Meanwhile, the background page persists user login in the browser.  By separating our scripts and using events, we keep things modular and scalable.

RACHEL - Originally, we were exploring the chrome api WebRequest for xmlhttp interception. We soon learned that it only allows us to modify the request headers but not encrypt the content itself. This led us to investigate using a Man In The Middle proxy. This proxy server would enable us to listen, encrypt and forward a message to the appropriate third party. The main deterrant to this approach was that we would need a Certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority. Given the time frame we had for this project we decided to look into what is now our current approach. We use an API to encrypt the content of a message before it reaches the service provider.

[ENCRYPTION TIMELINE] - TOM

TOM - When we're encrypting a message we use the widely adopted AES two-hundred and fifty six bit encryption method. We do this in the user's browser so that whenever it travels over the wire or is stored on a server, it's encrypted. We attach a unique identifier to the message and mark it with a flag. When an authenticated user views a flagged message, the extension checks the unique identifier and the user's permissions. If there is a match, we decrypt the message in their browser. This means that the content is never stored in an un-encrypted state.

[CLOSING] - ANGIE

Angie - Our app currently has the ability to encrypt and decrypt embedded pictures. So one of our goals is to be able to encrypt all attachments. Thanks to the scalability of our app, we are hoping to implement new features like sending email notifications to users when they are being added to a new circle, and be able to invite friends who are not currently using our app to join. Another site we are working on to support is Slack with potentials for many other communication service providers. Its been a great pleasure working together not to mention how much we have learned about chrome, security, and computer network structures. We are really excited and proud of how flexibe our app is and its potential to grow. Thank you all for your time.
